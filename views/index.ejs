    I have created this website to share my personal transformation into a Web Developer with the world.
    I will be sharing my new skills and knowledge with you through my personal <a href=/blog title="My blog">blog</a>.
    That is where I will be posting everything I know, and everything new that I am learning as I go, as well as
    some personal favorite recourses, tips, and tricks.
